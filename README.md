Using scRNA-seq to investigate the underlying transcriptional states that drive erythropoietin-dependent transitions within erythroid progenitor populations

Find versions of R and used packages under "session info".

Find raw code under "scRNA-seqAnalysis.Rmd". That code only includes analysis after demultiplexing by CellRanger
